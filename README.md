# slides-pptx
A script that copies a pair of words and inserts corresponding pictures into a new slide in PowerPoint using the pptx library.

**Instructions**:
1. Install pptx using `pip install python-pptx`
2. pptx doesn't support 3.6 so you'll have to use either 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5
3. Run the script!

That's pretty much it.
